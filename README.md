# NLP Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. The goal of this project is to develop a Question-Answering (Q&A) system that can provide answers based on a dataset of 120,000 articles. The system utilizes advanced techniques such as topic modeling and transformers to generate accurate and relevant answers to user queries.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal.
- Sentiment analysis: Classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- Named entity recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- Text classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes or topics.
- Language generation: Generating human-like text using techniques such as Markov chains or recurrent neural networks.
- Question-Answering system: Utilizing topic modeling and transformers to generate answers based on a dataset of 120,000 articles.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
3. Follow the prompts or modify the code to suit your needs.
